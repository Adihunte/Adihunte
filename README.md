- Hi, I’m Adihunte
- I’m interested in game development. Especially in new game mechanics and teknologi on a massive scalable size.
- Game engines I can use are (Game Maker Studio 2) and barely (Unreal Engine 4). And I'm interested in learning (Godot).
- Currently my skills are very strong theoretical and practical, but only in (Game Maker studio 2)'s language.
- Would love to learn more (C++), (networking) and (C++ code structure).
- My end goal is to make 2 MMOs. So any projects that give learning experience towards that is within my interest.
